/* Step 1.  Using Oracle’s SQL Developer interface (Project 7 describes its use)
, create the tables shown on the next page with their constraints.  Preface each 
table name with your initials LFM_ (Last First Middle and underscore).  
An example of a CREATE TABLE statement with both a primary key and a foreign key 
is in the Declaring a foreign key section of Chapter 07. 

Create the tables in an order that satisfies referential integrity.  
In the name for your primary key constraint, also include your initials because 
that name will be used for an auto-generated index, and the names for indexes 
and all objects must be unique in the database.
*/

/* Step 2.  Insert the rows of raw data into each table.  INSERT is described 
in Chapter 08.  Insert them in an order that satisfies referential integrity.  
You’ll insert rows into your LFM_Enroll table last. */

/* Step 3.  Update one row in each table.  UPDATE is described in Chapter 08.  
When each update statement executes, referential integrity must be satisfied.  
Your updates must satisfy referential integrity. */

/* Step 4.  Delete one row from each table.  DELETE is described in Chapter 08.  
The rows you delete cannot violate referential integrity (i.e., the deleted row 
cannot have a primary key that’s being referenced by some foreign key). */

/* Step 5.  Select all columns and rows from all tables.  SELECT is described in 
Chapter 08 and will be of form SELECT * FROM TableName;  where TableName is the 
name of a table.  The asterisk (*) will return all rows, and omitting the where 
clause (WHERE condition) will return values from all rows. */

/* Step 6.  Drop all tables, one by one, in an order that satisfies referential 
integrity with

DROP TABLE Tablename; 

where Tablename is the name of the table. */
