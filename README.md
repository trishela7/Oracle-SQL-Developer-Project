/* Step 0.  As a comment, include your filename (CS60_8_LastName_FirstName.SQL) 
and the date.

/* Step 1.  Using Oracleâ€™s SQL Developer interface (Project 7 describes its use)
, create the tables shown on the next page with their constraints.  Preface each 
table name with your initials LFM_ (Last First Middle and underscore).  
An example of a CREATE TABLE statement with both a primary key and a foreign key 
is in the Declaring a foreign key section of Chapter 07. 

Create the tables in an order that satisfies referential integrity.  
In the name for your primary key constraint, also include your initials because 
that name will be used for an auto-generated index, and the names for indexes 
and all objects must be unique in the database.
